# Project and Seminar

In the present project, called SALI (Sistema de Apoio a Lares de Idosos), a support system for nursing homes is proposed that aims to help not only the remote management of the home by its administrator, but also monitor the interactions of assistants and nurses with patients using NFC (Near Field Communication) bracelets.

This project includes a web api in .NET, a web application in React, a mobile application in react native, and also includes artificial intelligence to help diagnose diseases.

The repository exists in Azure Repositories and can be found in: https://dev.azure.com/isel-ps
